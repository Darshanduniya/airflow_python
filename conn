Step 1: Export Connections from the Old Server
First, you need to export the connections from your current Airflow instance. You can do this by running the airflow connections export command, which will generate a JSON file containing all the connection data.
On the old server, execute:
# Navigate to the Airflow home directory (if necessary)
cd ~/airflow

# Export connections to a JSON file
airflow connections export connections.json
This command will create a file named connections.json in your current directory with all the connection data from your old Airflow instance.
Step 2: Transfer the Exported File
Next, transfer the connections.json file from the old server to the new server. You can use scp (Secure Copy Protocol) for this purpose.
On your local machine or directly from the old server, execute:
# Replace `new_server_username` with the actual username on the new server
# Replace `new_server_host` with the actual hostname or IP address of the new server
# Replace `/path/to/new_airflow_directory` with the path to the Airflow directory on the new server
scp connections.json new_server_username@new_server_host:/path/to/new_airflow_directory
This command will copy the connections.json file to the specified directory on the new server.
Step 3: Import Connections to the New Server
Finally, on the new server, you will import the connections into the new Airflow instance using the airflow connections import command.
On the new server, execute:
# Navigate to the Airflow home directory (if necessary)
cd /path/to/new_airflow_directory

# Import connections from the JSON file
airflow connections import connections.json
This command will read the connections.json file and import all the connections into your new Airflow instance.
Additional Notes:
Ensure that the Airflow CLI is installed and properly configured on both the old and new servers.
The Airflow home directory is typically ~/airflow, but it may vary depending on your installation.
The airflow connections export/import commands are available starting from Airflow 2.0. If you are using an older version, you may need to manually export and import connections using the metadata database.
Handle the connections.json file securely, especially if it contains sensitive information such as passwords or secrets.
Verify that the new Airflow instance has the same providers installed as the old one, as some connections may depend on specific providers.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully migrate your Airflow connections from one server to another.
